{"texts": ["Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders: Evaluation and Management \n\u201cFunctional Abdominal Pain\u201d \nOSUWMC Clinical Practice Guideline \nMay 2022 \n \n \nWhat You Need to Know \n\u2022 \nPatients diagnosed with functional abdominal pain have high numbers of emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and \nreadmissions, as well as increased length of stay, lost productivity, and reduced quality of life. \n\u2022 \nSome patients have organic gastrointestinal disorders due to structural, inflammatory, or neoplastic conditions leading to \nabdominal pain. Once these have been ruled out, the patients likely have one of the abdominal pain syndromes summarized in \nTable 1. \n \nThe goal of this guideline is to provide a guide for standardization of care to improve morbidity, mortality, resource utilization and \nefficiency of care for patients in which no diagnosis other than functional abdominal pain can be made. \n\u2022 \nOpioids are NOT recommended for management of abdominal pain syndromes \n\u2022 \nCT Scans are NOT routinely recommended \n\u2022 \nMost abdominal pain syndrome patients should be treated as an outpatient \n\u2022 \nThis guideline is for diagnosis of exclusion and may require chart review for previous workup \n \nTable 1: Abdominal Pain Syndromes \nCentrally Mediated Abdominal Pain \nFormerly: Functional Abdominal Pain \n\u2022 \nContinuous, nearly continuous, or frequently recurring abdominal pain \n\u2022 \nPain does not change with eating, bowel movements, menses or with change in \nposition \nOpiate-Induced Gastrointestinal \nHyperalgesia/ Narcotic Bowel \nSyndrome (NBS) \n\u2022 \nChronic or frequently recurring abdominal pain that progressively and somewhat \nparadoxically increases despite continuing or escalating doses of opioids prescribed \nin an effort to relieve the pain \nIrritable Bowel Syndrome \n\u2022 \nAbdominal pain at least once a week \n\u2022 \nChange in stool frequency or stool consistency or both from usual \n\u2022 \nChange in abdominal pain related to defecation \nCyclic Vomiting \n\u2022 \nRecurrent episodes of severe nausea and vomiting interspersed with symptom-free \nperiods \n\u2022 \nAbdominal pain accompanies flare-ups and can be severe \n\u2022 \nTriggers: infections, psychologic stress, lack of sleep, motion sickness, physical \nexhaustion, menses and foods like chocolate and cheese \n\u2022 \nOften associated with Cannabis use \nAbdominal Wall Pain \n\u2022 \nPain worse with activity e.g., lifting or twisting, with laying on the affected side, \nwakes up patient from sleep \n\u2022 \nPain less with rest, with local application of heat \n\u2022 \nPain localizable with one fingertip \n\u2022 \nPositive physical exam sign is the Carnett\u2019s sign (with head or leg-raising) \nGastroparesis \n\u2022 \nChronic symptoms including nausea, vomiting, feeling very full after eating, inability \nto finish a regular sized meal, visible abdominal distension, anorexia, and weight loss \n\u2022 \nAbdominal pain is often present and worse post-prandially \n\u2022 \nDelayed gastric emptying: percent emptied from stomach 4 hours after a standard \nmeal is less than 90% \nFunctional Dyspepsia \n\u2022 \nChronic symptoms of post-prandial fullness and early satiety \n\u2022 \nEpigastric pain or burning \n\u2022 \nNo evidence of structural disease \nRelated OSUWMC Guidelines: Lower GI Bleed Guideline; Upper GI Bleed Guideline; Variceal Bleeding Guideline; Inflammatory \nBowel Disease Severe Colitis Guideline \n \nCopyright \u00a9 2018.
