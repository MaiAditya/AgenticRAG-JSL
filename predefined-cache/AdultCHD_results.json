With improved survival rates, there are now over 1.5 million adults in the US living with repaired or unrepaired CHD.\n\u2022\nACHD patients are at risk for cardiovascular and systemic complications, such as: cardiomyopathy (HFpEF and HFrEF), right heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, valvular heart disease, atrial and \nventricular arrhythmias, and chronic lung or kidney disease.\n\u2022\nThe 2018 AHA/ACC Guideline for Management of ACHD classifies congenital heart disease by both anatomy and physiology (Appendix A).\n\u2022\nPatients with severe anatomic forms of CHD, reduced functional status, and significant co-morbidities are at greater risk for complications.\n\u2022\nFor COVID-19 Considerations in patients with ACHD, see Patients with COVID-19 and Appendix B.\nConsiderations by Specific ACHD Lesions \nSingle Ventricle \u2013 Fontan Repair \nSystemic Right Ventricle \u2013 D-transposition of the great \narteries (D-TGA) s/p Mustard or Senning Repair; L-TGA \nCyanotic Congenital Heart Disease  - Unrepaired or \nPalliated CHD \nAnatomic \nDifferences \n\uf0a7\nOne ventricle pumping to systemic circulation (may be single right or left \nventricle)\n\uf0a7\nSVC connects directly to right pulmonary artery (RPA)\n\uf0a7\nIVC is baffled through/near right atrium to RPA \n\uf0a7\nNo right sided sub-pulmonic ventricle \u2013 all blood return to lungs is passive\n\uf0a7\nMorphologic right ventricle pumps blood to systemic circulation\n\uf0a7\nIn Mustard/Senning repair, blood is redirected by surgical baffles\n\uf0a7\nHypoxia is related to intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunting (right\nto left)\nOxygenation \n\uf0a7\nHypoxia (baseline SpO2 < 90%) due to underlying shunts (intracardiac/\nintrapulmonary) is common \n\uf0a7\nMay be caused by: baffle fenestration, venous collaterals, pulmonary AVMs \n\uf0a7\nPatients usually know their baseline SpO2 \n\uf0a7\nMay not respond as readily to supplemental O2\n\uf0a7\nIncreased risk of paradoxical embolus\n\uf0a7\nMay have higher baseline hemoglobin\n\uf0a7\nIn Mustard/Senning repair small shunts from baffle leaks are \ncommon, but baseline SpO2 rarely < 90% \n\uf0a7 \nMay not respond to supplemental oxygen as expected\n\uf0a7 \nSupplemental oxygen may decrease respiratory drive; goal SpO2 \nshould be close to baseline \nHemodynamic \n\uf0a7\nPatients are significantly PRELOAD dependent (have no subpulmonic ventricle)\no\nFluid resuscitation first with systemic hypotension or signs of low\ncardiac output\n\uf0a7\nWith any drop in SVR (sedation, intubation, and sepsis) may increase right to\nleft shunt and worsen hypoxia.
