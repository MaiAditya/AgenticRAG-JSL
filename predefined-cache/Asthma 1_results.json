If a patient is prescribed SABA-only reliever therapy, \nadherence to maintenance ICS is key to risk reduction.\n\u25aa Reliever therapy should include low dose ICS whenever SABA is used (or prescribed as ICS-SABA inhaler), or combination ICS-formoterol when this inhaler is used as both \nmaintenance and reliever therapy. Do NOT combine different ICS-LABA inhalers.\n\u25aa Personalized choice between strategies of therapy is key. Consideration of adherence to scheduled inhalers, cost of inhalers, and patient preference can guide between \npreferred and alternative controller and reliever therapies.  \n\u25aa Use of reliever > 2 days a week for symptom relief (not prevention of EIB) generally indicates inadequate control and the need to step up treatment. \nAnti-inflammatory relievers are preferred: PRN low dose ICS-formoterol when used as same Maintenance And Reliever Therapy (MART). Do not combine two ICS-LABA \nproducts for use in the same patient. If not using ICS-formoterol MART approach, AIR therapy can be achieved with PRN budesonide-albuterol instead of SABA-only \nreliever. Evidence is greatest for PRN ICS-SABA reliever at Step 3+.\nAlternate reliever: PRN SABA. If using SABA-only reliever therapy (with maintenance ICS), ensure patient adherence to ICS. No patient should be on SABA-only therapy. \nRELIEVER\nBefore Step Up in Therapy:\n\u25aa Review with patient adherence to medication, inhaler technique, environmental control, and comorbid conditions.\n\u25aa If alternative treatment is used and response is inadequate, discontinue it and use the preferred treatment before stepping up.\nCopyright \u00a91998.
